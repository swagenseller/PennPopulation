# PennPopulation
I choose to do a topographical map for Pennsylvania, but I was unfortunately, unable to create the Topojson file.
Instead I just recreated the California example with two buttons enabling to change the color of the state to blue and then back to original red.  I wanted to get to the county boundaries and census but then again ran into creating the Topojson file
