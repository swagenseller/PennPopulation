# PennPopulation
I choose to do a topographical map for Pennsylvania.
This map is based off Mike Bostock's California Density Population, the following is a link to it: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5562380

Please enable unsafe scripts on your browser when viewing the website of my map. If you don't, it may not display the map but will display everything else.  Clicking change color will change the color to blue and reset will change it back to red.
I wasn't able to create buttons to remove the boundary lines or state lines
